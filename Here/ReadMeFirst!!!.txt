Rirstly, go to "RunMeFirst-Drivers", and run the program. this will make sure
that all the things needed to run the software are in place.

once you have run the drivers, you do not need to run it again, unless you move computers!

When you open the program, click F5 to run.

IMPORTANT Note: The program will allow you to read multiple files...
However, this is not recommended, as it will lead to issues
with credentials Google. It will most likeley need a re-download
and setup of credentials, due to Google's security policy
If you do not wish to read another file, click enter 2x
and answer "yes" when prompted. It is NOT ADVISED.
Unless you clear the spreadsheet and restart the program...
